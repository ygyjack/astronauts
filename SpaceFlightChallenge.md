***Recommended development time:*** 4 hours
	* if more time taken, please note the completion time

The FullTilt Space Agency is to launch an expedition into Space – the final frontier - to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and civilizations, to boldly go where no human has gone before! Great discoveries and great dangers await our brave astronauts! 
 
To help them survive and complete their mission the all-new and innovative "Space Buddy System" is being introduced:
Each astronaut is assigned a buddy to take care of during the mission
It is possible that astronaut A gets astronaut B, astronaut B gets astronaut C, astronaut C gets astronaut A, astronaut D gets astronaut E, astronaut E gets astronaut D – so one can become a buddy to his/her buddy!
Some Agency officials say that the dog should be treated equally to any member of the crew
 
The legacy system had all the pairings decided by the committee. You have been chosen to build a single-page web application that will randomly generate the associations. Be creative but mindful of FTSA procedures:
	* PSD mockup has been approved
	* users.json file cannot be modified
	* GUI/UX can be improved, you can use http://icomoon.io/app/#/select to replace the icons
	* http://cdnjs.com is available via the satellite link if you need any libraries
 
You can get extra stars if you cater for the following scenarios:
	* Astronauts will use multiple terminals to access stored assignments
	* FTSA might want to run social experiment and make the results confidential: astronaut has to be authorised to see assigned buddy
	* Connection speed might be an issue and terminals differ from handheld HiDPI devices to large screens on the flight deck
	* Future generations will benefit from documentation and tracked progress for training purposes
	* Unknown and unfinished features can be clarified and completed by our team together later – just let us know what you think should be made better.

Breakdown
=================================================================


Task
--
* Recreate mockup to a one page web application helping the astronauts before the launch.
* A listed astronaut will be assinged another to take care of during the mission.
* Display all astronaut assingnments upon clickng the "Launch" button.
* Assignments don't have to be bi-driectional: A gets B, B gets C, C gets A, D gets E, E gets D
* Extra stars for going above and beyond. For Example:
	* Making the results confidential
	* Taking dog into consideration
	* Storing data outside of the session
	* HiDPI / prepocessed code / documentation and questions
* Please feel free to decide on architecture, layout, features and logic not stated above. Be creative.

Guidelines
--
* Please find attached high fidelity PSD and reference JPG.
	* Use placeholder assets if Photoshop can't be used.
* Use libraries linked from public CDNs (e.g. [cdnjs.com] https://cdnjs.com/).
* Feature detection can be used to differentiate the experience.
* Performance is a key factor as we are expecting customers to visit the website via low bandwith connection on variety of operating systems.
* Please replace supplied icons with files of your choice from [IcoMoon] http://icomoon.io/app/#/select
* Use included users.json file but do not modify it.
